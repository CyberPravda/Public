# CyberPravda — sybil-resistant service of veracity

**1. Logistics.** 

**Provide a brief description of your technology, tool, or proposal.** 

We are developing a global independent decentralized blockchain platform Cyberpravda.com to analyze the veracity of any controversial topics. From ordinary everyday issues to the most challenging science and cutting-edge modern technologies.

We have found a way to mathematically determine the veracity of information and have developed a fundamentally new algorithm that does not require the use of cryptographic certificates of states and corporations, voting tokens that can bribe any user, or hallucinating artificial intelligence algorithms that learn from each other to get better and better at falsifying all kinds of content. The algorithm does not require external administration, review by experts or special content curators. It has neither semantics nor linguistics — all these approaches have not justified themselves. We have found a unique and very unusual combination of mathematics, psychology and game theory and have developed a purely mathematical international multilingual correlation algorithm that allows us to get a deeper scientometric assessment of the accuracy and reliability of information sources compared to the PageRank algorithm or the Hirsch index. At a very fundamental level, it revolutionizes existing information technologies, making a turn from information verification to the world's first algorithm for analyzing its compliance with Popper's falsifiability criterion, which is the foundation of the scientific method. The algorithm is completely transparent and visible to all users of the system. Everyone will know the rules of the game and will be able to check them at any time. All this makes possible to assign each message in the system a credibility rating, and authors — a reputation rating.

The Cyberpravda project is an innovative platform designed to analyze and verify information, making it a powerful tool for addressing any contentious scientific or societal issue — from climate change and vaccine efficacy to political disputes and economic theories.

**Analyzing controversial hypotheses.** Many scientific and societal debates suffer from conflicting theories, biased interpretations, and a lack of consensus. Whether the topic is quantum physics interpretations, economic policies, or public health strategies, each of these hypotheses has its supporters and critics, leading to confusion and lack of consensus in the scientific community. Cyberpravda provides tools for:

**Data systematization** — The platform allows collecting and structuring information from different sources, making it easier to compare and analyze different hypotheses.

**Fact verification** — Cyberpravda uses fact-checking algorithm to help separate scientifically valid data from unreliable information.

**Analyzing relationships** — The project can help identify connections between different hypotheses and theories, revealing hidden patterns and gaps in reasoning.

**Identifying the most reliable solutions.** In fields like medicine, economics, and technology, conflicting studies and vested interests often obscure the best solutions. CyberPravda helps by:

**Evaluating Evidence** — The platform assesses the strength of studies, expert opinions, and real-world data to determine which solutions are most credible.

**Identifying new research directions** — Data analysis can identify gaps in current research and suggest new hypotheses for further study.

**Forming a scientific community** — Cyberpravda facilitates the exchange of ideas between scientists and researchers, which can lead to faster progress and developing new methods.

CyberPravda is not limited to one field — it’s a universal framework for resolving debates in science, policy, and society. By systematically verifying claims, mapping conflicting viewpoints, and incentivizing honest discourse, it helps communities find truth amid chaos. Whether the topic is aging research, AI ethics, or geopolitical conflicts, CyberPravda provides the tools to separate fact from fiction and move toward evidence-based solutions.

**2. What problem(s) are you trying to solve?** 

The Internet is full of fakes. Lies, fake news, fabricated documents and media hoaxes have overwhelmed social and traditional media. There are fakes everywhere and it's hard to find the truth. Even peer reviewed scientific journals have experienced a flood of falsifications. And even in trusted sources of information such as Wikipedia, authors are often under pressure from administrators to promote biased opinions, even though the qualifications of the administrators are often unknown and numerical criteria for calculating scientometric indicators of reputation and veracity are simply not available.

Existing information resources always represent the opinions of specific authors. Each author is biased and prejudiced in his own way. Each author is in his own information bubble and the authors we choose to consume information draw us into their personal reality tunnel, which leads to cognitive illusions and losses when making important business decisions.
  
Twitter, Facebook, Telegram, Instagram, YouTube, Tiktok always suggest to subscribe to someone and at the same time you must trust the corporate recommendation algorithm, which provides authors similar to everyone the user is subscribed to. All this draws users deeper and deeper into the information bubble and reduces their personal tunnel of reality.

There is no platform in the world where you can explore all the conflicting information on any important topic in its entirety. You can find any topic in an online encyclopedia like Wikipedia, but 90% of Wikipedia articles reflect a single point of view. And attempting to add an alternative opinion there leads to an edit war and deletion by biased administrators. It's a stalemate.

It's only going to get worse. We have no more than a year until maleficent neural networks will deliberately mislead us. Everyone knows what Kali Linux is, but in the near future we will have to face KaliGPT and JihadGPT. And existing protection methods will not be adequate. Some experts on artificial intelligence suggest that in the near future no one will be able to verify the veracity of a fact among many convincing generations without investing $10,000 to verify it. This is approximately equal to a week of work for a large factchecking department in a large publishing house.

And when fraudsters start using advanced neural networks for scamming, the chances of solving this problem will rapidly slip to zero. Once the digital superiority of neural networks over the smartest human has been achieved, no one else is capable of it. The evolution speed of neural networks is now 3 million times faster than that of humans and humans are no longer the smartest species on the Earth. And the ability of neural networks to speak to humans in their own language and at the same time say exactly what they want to hear from them breaks through psychological defense barriers and opens grandiose opportunities for social engineering for fraudsters. But neither you, nor me, nor any expert or anyone at all will be able to distinguish fake from reality.

Content veracity is the ultimate philosophical question. In the near future, artificial intelligence will be everywhere. But Michael Levin's theorem (https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/26/3/194) proves that it will always have unrecoverable hallucinations and AI will never be able to claim veracity. You can and should apply AI in your business, but you have to be responsible for the decisions you make. And decisions can be complex and expensive. And AI at a fundamental level cannot justify and guarantee the reliability of its generations. As a result, most of the Internet will become a neural network-generated hallucination.

LLMs can degenerate by learning from their own hallucinations on the Internet and humans will degenerate by applying the degenerated LLMs. This process is called "neural network collapse". It was described in this articles https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17493v2 and https://gradual-disempowerment.ai. For mutual validation and self-improvement of LLM and humans, we need the ability to match the knowledge of artificial intelligence with collective intelligence. This is the only thing that can get us out of the personal tunnels of reality and personal information bubbles in which we are getting deeper and deeper stuck individually. And for all of this, we need a reliability rating of human knowledge. 

All this is aggravated by the fact that all factchecking in information technologies is now based solely on the principle of verification (i.e. confirmation). But this approach becomes unacceptable in modern conditions after the superiority of AI over humans and should be fundamentally replaced by the principle of falsifiability. It means that the verification of the meaningfulness and then the veracity of hypotheses should be carried out not through the search for facts that confirm them, but mainly (or even exclusively) through the search for facts that refute them. This approach is fundamental in the scientific world, but for some unknown reason it has not been implemented anywhere in information technologies until today.

**What use cases are you addressing?** 

Our mission is to raise the world's level of objectivity. To give people a tool that allows them to quickly assess the truthfulness of all information, from the commonplace to the scientific. Our motto is “The whole truth in one place”.

This application will allow people to discuss different points of view, compare "whose truth is greater", filter out fake news, lies and irresponsible authors and at the same time come to a reasoned consensus. The most trivial examples are, for instance, is the Earth round or flat? What kind of oil to fill an engine? Which coronavirus vaccine is more effective? And many other things.

**Readers** can easily find in one place all the conflicting viewpoints on any topic in the form of an article in their own language and see the veracity rating of each version.

**Experts** can write down their statements on a controversial issue because they need professional recognition.

**Knowledge workers** can inspect veracity and accuracy of different opinions because they must avoid disinformation.

**Gamblers and disputants** are attracted to intellectual challenge. They enjoy analyzing complex situations, predicting outcomes and betting on controversial  hypotheses. This offers them high reward potential and sharpens critical thinking.

**Corporate clients** are anyone who pays for a fact check, underlying their business (consulting and analytical agencies, news agencies, journalistic communities, financial organizations, marketing departments of commercial companies, international funds, state commissions and many others). Accuracy and reliability of information is a key factor for them in decision making. They realize that incorrect or incomplete information can lead to negative consequences such as loss of money, time and reputation. The truthfulness and reliability of information can help them make better informed decisions based on facts and data analysis.

**How do you define credibility?** 

Reputation and trust are based on people saying what they do and doing what they say, so we need for an independent system to objectively and unbiasedly verify the veracity of information and compare any existing opinions for mutual consistency and noncontradiction. We developed a factchecking solution that can counter existing technologies of falsification and misinformation on the basis of an algorithm that implements Popper's falsifiability criterion for this purpose.

Technology is based on a purely mathematical algorithm that does not require external administration, certificates of states and corporations, hired experts or special content curators. This algorithm allows to realize the principle of falsifiability, algorithmically implement Popper's criterion and obtain a more precise assessment of veracity compared to the PageRank algorithm and the Hirsch index, which analyze each site or document only in its entirety and are unable to assess the contradictions between the individual facts and arguments of which they consist.

Algorithm is based on the principle that for some facts and arguments people are willing to bear reputational responsibility, while for others they are not. The algorithm identifies these contradictions and finds holistically consistent chains of scientific knowledge. And these are not likes or dislikes, which can be manipulated, and not votes, which can be falsified. Each author publishes his own version of events, for which he is reputationally responsible, not upvoting someone else's.

In the global hypergraph, any information is an argument of something one and a counterargument of something else. Different versions compete with each other in terms of the value of the flow of meaning, and the most reliable versions become arguments in the chain of events for facts of higher or lower level, which loops the chain of mutual interaction of arguments and counterarguments and creates a global hypergraph of knowledge, in which the greatest flow of meaning flows through stable chains of consistent scientific knowledge that best meet the principle of falsifiability and Popper's criterion.

The algorithm is based on the fact that scientific knowledge is noncontradictory, while ignorames, bots and trolls, on the contrary, drown each other in a flood of contradictory arguments. The opinion of a flat Earth has a right to exist, but it is supported by only one line from the Bible, which in turn is not supported by anything, yet it fundamentally contradicts all the knowledge contained in textbooks of physics, chemistry, math, biology, history and millions of others. And yet all kinds of information are connected. Mathematics is related to physics, physics to chemistry, chemistry to geology, geology to history, history to literature, literature to poetry, poetry to music, and music is pure mathematics.

The algorithm up-ranks facts that have confirmed evidences with extended multiple noncontradictory chains of proven facts, while down-rating arguments that are refuted by reliable facts confirmed by their noncontradictory chains of confirmed evidences. Unproven arguments are ignored, and chains of statements that are built on them are discarded.

The algorithm has natural self-protection from manipulations, because regardless of any number of authors each fact in the decentralized database is one single information block and regardless of any number of opinions any pair of facts is connected by one single edge. The flow of meaning in the logical chain of the picture of events does not depend on its length, and unreasonable branching of the factual statement leads to the separation of the semantic flow and reduces the credibility of each individual branch, for which we have to prove its veracity anew.

Similar to Wikipedia, the algorithm creates articles on any controversial topic, which are dynamically rearranged according to new incoming evidences and desired levels of veracity set by readers in their personal settings ranging from zero to 100%. As a result, users have access to multiple Wikipedia-like articles describing competing versions of events, ranked by objectivity according to their desired credibility level, and the smart contract allows them to earn money by betting on different versions of events and fulfilling orders to verify their veracity.

**Describe the actors involved.**

Our customers are Internet users over 16 years old from all over the world (109 languages and
5 continents). Our main focus are the European and US markets with 675 million active internet users.

We roughly divide future users of CyberPravda into five types:

● Readers (Lisa)
● Disputers (Mike)
● Experts (Paul)
● Corporate customers (Alexander)
● Gamblers (John)

All of these users have different motivations in the system. Readers want to quickly find reliable information on practical issues. Disputers want to defend their point of view. And experts in various fields get a tool to publish their knowledge. All of these user types are united by the competitive aspect of their personal reputation, whose value in the society of the future will only increase with time.

**A typical customer**

**Mike the disputant.** Mike is an intelligent person around 40. Mike enjoys commenting on various Facebook posts and engaging in arguments. He wants to prove his opponents wrong, but his coherent logical arguments are met with more and more emotionally-charged contradictory information.

Mike dreams of giving his opponents a link with definitive proof that he is right. Mike uses CyberPravda to do this. He takes his arguments to the CyberPravda app where other users confirm or deny his claims. Eventually Mike gets a credibility rating and shares it on Facebook, thus attracting new users to CyberPravda.

**Lisa the reader.** Lisa is a young mother of 29. She needs reliable information on practical issues, such as which further education programme to choose, or whether her child needs a health certificate for dance lessons. Lisa is used to finding all this information quickly on CyberPravda, using a filter based on her credibility rating.

**Paul the expert.** Paul is a physics professor at a university. In his spare time, Paul is an investigator and a member of the European Investigators' Organization. Paul's team investigates high-profile events such as the causes of airliner crashes, or the mechanism of famine in Africa and more. Paul is used to structuring his information and is very responsible with facts and evidence. Paul frequently publishes his investigations. In these publications he provides many references and evidence for his conclusions.

Paul has set up a verified account with CyberPravda and verified his academic credentials there. His voice in the system now carries more weight. Paul publishes his investigations on CyberPravda and they are confirmed by most experts. People quote and borrow his information all the time. Paul has built up his reputation with CyberPravda over the years and it is now very high.

**Alexander the corporate customer.** Alexander is the head of a large group of experts in a large corporation. Alexander's department has many experienced specialists, but no matter how many experts there are on any issue, there are often tasks for which Alexander does not have a suitable employee or there is only one expert, and Alexander realizes that the opinion of this expert is one-sided and limited. Alexander would like to compare different points of view, but it is long and expensive to search for and hire outsourced experts, and the task requires an urgent solution.  In addition, Alexander is concerned that his experts are starting to use ChatGPT more and more often to create shallow reports instead of deep research and elaboration of tasks. Alexander would like to check whether his employees are not slipping him hackwork and find out the reliability of the analyzed information.

Alexander finds a link to the Cyberpravda service of veracity on the expert forum and creates a topic on the issue he is interested in with the main hypotheses he would like to consider. To this topic he attaches a small prize fund for the authors who will find and publish the most reliable information on the issue he is interested in and sets a deadline for prize distribution. A lot of specialists and experts from all over the world publish their facts and arguments on this issue and a picture of the available knowledge is formed from a multitude of facts. 

**John the gambler.** John is a beer lover and bar regular, extroverted, a balaguer and enjoys chatting with random conversationalists on any topic. Loves gambling and relishes the opportunity to try his luck in an informal setting. Tends to make emotional decisions based on intuition or personal experience, but not based on detailed analysis of data or precise knowledge. In bars there are often heated arguments on various issues and often John feels that he knows he is right and is even ready to try his luck and bet on his version of events. John proposes to his companions to make a bet for a small amount of money to make the argument more interesting and exciting. His companions cheerfully support him.

**3. Explain the chain of events that help assess credibility in your proposal. What architectural choices have you made that enable this?**

Such a system must satisfy to the highest principles of scientific honesty:

— the system must be completely independent of admins, biased experts, special content curators, oracles, certificates of states and corporations, clickbait likes/dislikes or voting tokens that can bribe any user

— the system should be global, international, multi-lingual and free of charge to be accessible for users all over the world

— the system should be unbiased to all authors and open to the publication of any opinions and hypotheses

— the system must be objective and purely mathematically evaluate all facts and arguments without exception according to the principle of "all with all" immediately the moment they were published

— the system must be decentralized and cryptographically secured insuring that even its creators have no way of influencing the veracity and reputation

— the system should be available for audit and independent verification at any time.

The technical solution is a discussion platform for crowdsourcing reliable information with a monetization ecosystem, game mechanics, and a graph theory based algorithm that objectively compares all existing points of view. It is a combination of existing technologies that are guaranteed to meet all requirements of objectivity and unbiasedness:

— it is built on a blockchain with an independent mathematical algorithm for analysis of the veracity of arguments on the basis of graph theory with auto-translation of content into 109 languages

— credibility arises only from the mutual influence of at least two different competing hypotheses and does not depend on the number of proponents who defend them

— credibility arises only from the mutual competition of facts and arguments and their interactions with each other

— the only way to influence credibility in this system is to publish your personal opinion on any topic, which will be immediately checked by an unbiased mathematical algorithm for consistency with all other facts and arguments existing in the system

— each author in the system has personal reputational responsibility for the veracity of published arguments.

The only thing from this list we have not implemented yet is that we don't have enough funds to launch Cyberpravda on the blockchain. It is currently running on our server.

We really need help and support to implement these ideals in a complete way!

**4. Which role(s) does your proposal fill in the ecosystem (noting that some tools fill multiple roles):**
* Content Consumer - Person receiving the information (audience, reader)
* Content Provider/Source - Person(s) or organizations delivering content 
* Content Promoter - Person(s) or organization that amplify the spread of information
* Credibility Facilitator - Person(s) or organization who is helping the consumer decide what to trust.
* Platform - Technological system, and by extension the person or organization who maintains and controls it. 

The CyberPravda project primarily serves the following roles in the ecosystem:

**Credibility Facilitator** – the core focus is helping users assess content trustworthiness using an independent mathematical algorithm to objectively analyze the credibility of statements and assess the reputation of their authors. On the basis of the calculated rating, a digital certificate of reliability of published information is formed, protected from spoofing and falsification by cryptographic methods as NFT (non-fungible tokens) that cannot be sold, bought, transferred or hacked by other users, but users who made a significant contribution to the knowledge database can earn money proportionately with NFTs which express their reputation rating. 

**Content Provider/Source** – it aids providers in delivering verifiable content by standardizing rating of veracity as dynamic NFT (non-fungible token) and rating of reputation as SBT (soulbound token).

**Platform** – it defines technical standards for platforms (e.g., browsers or content management systems) to implement ratings of veracity of information and reputation of its authors. These ratings should become the basis for new types of web crawling algorithms and new services for ranking information in social networks, allowing to filter out fake news, falsifications, lies and irresponsible authors. In addition, it allows to create a mechanism of mutual verification and self-improvement of neural networks and humans to compare the knowledge of artificial intelligence with the collective intelligence of real people with real, not learned knowledge, skills and experience. This allows us to build a fundamentally new trust algorithm for the activities of anonymous decentralized and cryptographically protected blockchain organizations, which have fundamental advantages in competition with global corporations.

Secondary roles:
**Content Consumer** – indirectly benefits consumers by enabling trust signals in their tools (e.g., browsers).
**Content Promoter** – could help legitimate promoters by distinguishing credible content from manipulated/misleading material.

**5. Which <a href="https://www.w3.org/2018/10/credibility-tech/#h.32pkwj5grlt3">technical approaches</a> do you enable? Are there other ecosystem players that enable the technical approaches with which you will interoperate? Please elaborate**
* Inspection
* Corroboration
* Reputation
* Transparency

The CyberPravda project employs a unique blend of mathematical, psychological, and game-theoretic techniques to assess credibility. 

## **1. Inspection**  
- **Graph Theory-Based Analysis**: The algorithm evaluates content by mapping arguments into a hypergraph, where nodes represent facts and edges represent logical relationships (support/contradiction).
- **Popper’s Falsifiability Criterion**: Instead of verifying claims, the system searches for contradictions, downranking arguments that fail falsifiability tests.  
- **Automated Consistency Checks**: The system dynamically checks new claims against existing knowledge chains, identifying inconsistencies.
- **Automated Detection**: The algorithm flags low-credibility content by detecting logical fallacies, unsupported claims, or contradictions with established facts.  
- **Dynamic Credibility Scoring**: Each claim receives a real-time credibility rating based on its position in the hypergraph (e.g., claims with multiple supporting non-contradictory chains rank higher).  
- **User-Facing Indicators**: Readers see credibility scores (e.g., "90% consistent with verified facts") without manual effort.  
- **Scalable & Unbiased**: No reliance on human moderators or subjective judgments.  
- **Resistant to Manipulation**: Unlike likes/votes, credibility depends on logical coherence, not popularity.  

## **2. Corroboration**  
- **Crowdsourced Fact-Checking**: Users contribute supporting/refuting evidence, forming a decentralized verification network.  
- **Smart Contracts for Incentivization**: Users earn rewards (via NFTs/SBTs) for providing high-quality corroborating evidence.  
- **Automated Claim Matching**: The system links similar claims across languages and sources, creating a global knowledge web.  
- **Multi-Source Validation**: Claims are cross-checked against academic papers, verified experts, and opposing viewpoints.  
- **Dynamic Fact-Checking**: Instead of static fact-checks, the system updates credibility scores as new evidence emerges.  
- **Dispute Resolution**: Conflicting claims are resolved via algorithmic analysis of evidence strength (e.g., peer-reviewed studies > anonymous posts).  
- **Reduces Confirmation Bias**: Forces engagement with counterarguments.  
- **Adaptive to New Information**: Unlike traditional fact-checking, it evolves with new data.  

## **3. Reputation**  
- **Soulbound Tokens (SBTs)**: Non-transferable reputation scores tied to users’ contributions.  
- **Expert Verification**: Academics/professionals can verify credentials, increasing their influence in debates.  
- **Decentralized Reputation Networks**: No central authority controls reputation; it emerges from consensus in the hypergraph.  
- **Author Trust Scores**: Users see reputation ratings (e.g., "Physics Professor: 95% reliable").  
- **Anti-Sybil Mechanisms**: Prevents fake accounts by requiring reputational stakes (e.g., losing SBTs for spreading debunked claims).  
- **DAO Governance**: High-reputation users guide community decisions (e.g., moderating disputes).  
- **Tamper-Proof**: Blockchain ensures reputational data cannot be faked.  
- **Granular & Contextual**: Reputation is topic-specific (e.g., a biologist may have high credibility on vaccines but low credibility on economics).  

## **4. Transparency**  
- **Provenance Tracking**: All edits and sources are cryptographically signed and stored on-chain.  
- **Open Algorithm Rules**: The credibility-scoring logic is public, allowing audits.  
- **Content Labeling**: Articles display metadata (e.g., "Verification funded by X Corp" or "Peer-reviewed by 3 experts").  
- **Auditability**: Users can trace how a credibility score was derived (e.g., "This claim contradicts 5 peer-reviewed studies").  
- **Incentivized Honesty**: Authors gain higher reputation for transparent disclosures.  
- **Reduces Deception**: Makes manipulation harder.  
- **User Empowerment**: Readers adjust trust thresholds (e.g., "Only show claims with >80% transparency").  

## **Combination of Strategies**  
CyberPravda integrates all four strategies into a unified system:  
1. **Inspection + Corroboration**: The hypergraph algorithm (Inspection) dynamically cross-references claims (Corroboration).  
2. **Reputation + Transparency**: The author’s ratings (Reputation) adjusts based on claim validity and all steps are recorded on-chain (Transparency).  
3. **Feedback Loops**: High-reputation users’ contributions are weighted more heavily in Inspection, creating a self-reinforcing trust mechanism.  

This system could redefine online trust. CyberPravda’s innovation lies in its mathematically rigorous, decentralized approach to credibility assessment. Unlike traditional tools (e.g., fact-checkers or reputation systems), it:  
- **Avoids centralization risks** (no single entity controls truth).  
- **Scales globally** (works across languages/cultures).  
- **Incentivizes truth-seeking** (via crypto-economic rewards).  
- **Browser Integration**: Display credibility scores alongside search results.  
- **AI Collaboration**: Use LLMs to summarize debates while retaining auditability.  
- **Cross-Platform Standards**: Interoperability with existing fact-checking tools (e.g., ClaimReview).  

**6. Describe how your technology, tool, or proposal works from a technical perspective.**

How does it work? One person opens the Cyberpravda app or website, logs in and writes some information on any version of events. Another person supports this version with his facts and arguments and, for example, attaches a photo or a document, a third person adds a refuting fact and links it to the website, a scientist with a verified scientific degree provides his proof and attaches his academic publications, and so on. Huge branching and intersecting chains of information are built up, generally looking like chaos.

And to avoid drowning in the flows of fakes, falsifications and neural network hallucinations, we have developed a unique objective and unbiased purely mathematical algorithm based on graph theory to compare different points of view for mutual consistency and coherence according to the principle of "all with all", which verifies all publications for compliance with Popper's falsifiability criterion and allows us to assess the credibility rating of each hypothesis and the reputation ratings of its authors.

Different versions compete with each other in terms of the value of the flow of meaning, and the most reliable versions become arguments in the chain of events for facts of higher or lower level, which loops the chain of mutual interaction of arguments and counterarguments and creates a global hypergraph of knowledge, in which the greatest flow of meaning flows through stable chains of consistent scientific knowledge that best meet the principle of falsifiability and Popper's criterion. A critical path in the sequence of the most credible facts forms an automatically generated multi-lingual article for each of the existing versions of events, which is dynamically rearranged according to new incoming evidences and the desired credibility levels set by readers in their personal settings ranging from zero to 100%. As a result, users have access to multiple Wikipedia-like articles describing competing versions of events, ranked by objectivity according to their desired level of credibility.

At a very fundamental level, it revolutionizes existing information technologies, making a turn from information verification to the world's first algorithm for analyzing its compliance with Popper's falsifiability criterion, which is the foundation of the scientific method.

With blockchain, the algorithm will be fully transparent and obvious to all users of the system. Any user will know the rules of the game and will be able to instantly observe all the existing facts and arguments on any hot news or sensational topic and check which versions of events are the most reliable without spending a long and painful time collecting all the information from contradictory sources.

Anyone can become an author, but it is not necessary. Everyone can be just a reader and use the system without authorization to quickly check the veracity of any information and the reputation of its authors, add comments, or read proofs, refutations and alternative versions.

By a lucky coincidence, this blockchain algorithm is highly monetizable through smart contracts (event contracts) for orders to find and verify reliable information and for betting on different versions of events. It allows paying prizes to the authors of the most credible content and creates an economic basis for the development of new socially responsible journalism.

In addition, it allows to create a mechanism of mutual verification and self-improvement of neural networks and humans to compare the knowledge of artificial intelligence with the collective intelligence of real people with real, not learned knowledge, skills and experience. This allows us to build a fundamentally new trust algorithm for the activities of anonymous decentralized and cryptographically protected blockchain organizations, which have fundamental advantages in competition with global corporations.

Fixing the problem of trust and veracity of information will accelerate the mass adoption of blockchain technology and raise the value of cryptocurrencies by disqualifying fraudsters and their numerous scam projects.

**8. Provide any research or evidence supporting the effectiveness of your tool.**

We made mathematical modeling that shows that after creating a million information blocks, the leading scientific hypothesis consistently wins the credibility rating over competing versions of ignorames, bots and trolls. And reputation ratings of academical minority are much higher than ratings of countless ignorames, bots, and trolls and that gap only widens as the total number of publications grows.

**9. What aspects of your proposal would benefit from being standardized? With which systems does it need to interoperate? How will this fit into existing technical and social systems (e.g. browser extension, peer review)?**

Once the blockchain protocol is launched and debugged, we plan to open it to be developed and improved by the user community. Then we can build a system of economic relations based on reliable knowledge and responsible executors with real reputation, in which DAO management candidates for leadership positions analyze trends and develop plans and strategies with reputational responsibility. Each candidate builds his personal description of the factual statement. In open and fair competition with other candidates and any opponents, which can be any participant of the system, candidates defend their claims, provide evidences and refute the arguments of critics. Unbiased and objective algorithm finds the most reliable sequences of facts and assigns authors a reputation rating.

Management candidates, whose strategies and investment plans have the highest credibility rating, receive digital identifiers that allow them to make necessary decisions in the organization. The managers' performance is evaluated for compliance with their developed plans and strategies in decentralized arbitrage services, confirming the fact that the goals have been achieved. Confirmations of goal achievement become facts for arguing new strategies and developing new investment plans and the cycle closes, becoming self-sustaining and self-organizing.

Our global goal is to create a fundamental basis for trust in any DAO. Unfortunately, I am convinced at a conceptual level that without solving this problem, the DAO and the Web3 will not be able to develop further for very fundamental reasons.

If all these challenges are overcome and combined, then the digital cyber economy gains strength and global collaboration becomes a reality! Decentralized organizations will be able to equal the size of global transnational corporations, and crypto, instead of speculation or occasional enthusiast exchanges and rare cross-border transactions, will become the lifeblood of the cyber-economy and begin to create real surplus value for genuine, not speculative, capitalization growth!
 
**10. Create a threat model for your technology, tool, or proposal. Are there potential unintended consequences, such as enabling censorship or increasing bias? What are potential attack vectors? What can be done to mitigate these risks?**

**LOW PROBABILITY**
Defamation lawsuits: hiring the best lawyers
Lack of users: mailing lists on forums and social networks
Copying by competitors: keep the pace of development high

**MEDIUM PROBABILITY**
Dictatorship and totalitarian censorship: incorporation in Spain 
Social media boycott of ratings: replacing NFT with hyperlinks
Mistake in method: pivoting to a corporate app

**HIGH PROBABILITY**
Cyberattacks: application of the most advanced blockchain protocols
Cryptocurrency regulation: deversification of fiat income
Ratings hacking: attracting the best developers and mathematicians

**11. What do you hope for in this effort?**

We need investments to finalize application. We need professional expertize of regulatory environment and legal systems. We have a greate hope to meet with the best experts in blockchain algoritms and architecture of distributed decentralised global databases.
